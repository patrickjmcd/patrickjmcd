## Technical Leadership & Impact  <!-- pdf-exclude -->
- Owned and evolved platform-critical services supporting security-sensitive data at scale
- Led architectural migrations from serverless to Kubernetes across multi-team systems
- Set engineering standards for APIs, data models, and developer experience
- Worked across product, infrastructure, and security boundaries to deliver reliable systems
- Mentored engineers and served as escalation point for complex system issues

---

## Systems Philosophy  <!-- pdf-exclude -->
- Design services to do as few things as possible, favoring clear boundaries over over-complication
- Treat product and engineering as a single problem-solving partnership with shared ownership of outcomes
- Build minimum lovable products (instead of minimum viable products) through rapid prototyping, frequent stakeholder feedback, and iterative refinement
- Great-functioning products with poor design are often experienced as bad products by non-technical users
